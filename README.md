# Project 1: Cocktail Bar Stocktake Application

## About the Project

* This web based application is designed to help manage the stock at a small cocktail bar. 

* The application will feature 3 pages, a menu page, a current stock page and a future stock page. 

* The menu will have a list of all the cocktails along with pictures of the cocktails, ingredients and methods they are made.

* The current stock page will show how much of each spirit is in stock, and allow you to enter in how many of each cocktail was sold that day.

* The future stock page will show the most popular cocktail, the upcoming weather, a cash flow tables and then give a suggestion on what stock to buy for the upcoming week based on sales from the previous week and the upcoming weather.
